# 👋 Hi, I’m Yogeesh

I’m a backend engineer with 3+ years of experience designing scalable systems in healthcare, cybersecurity, and HR tech. I specialize in building clean, modular, and high-performance backends using Python, Django, and the usual cast of serious infrastructure tools.

I believe good software should be:
- Easy to understand
- Hard to break
- And ideally… written by someone else by the time it becomes legacy :)
